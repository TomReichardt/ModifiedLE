# Modified Lane-Emden Equation Solver

This project is an implementation of the modified Lane-Emden equation method laid out by Ohlmann et al. (2017). It reconstructs the core of a stellar profile within a specified radius such that it is consistent with having the core condensed into a point mass with softened gravitational potential.
