# Modified Lane-Emden Equation Solver

This project is an implementation of the modified Lane-Emden equation method laid out by [Ohlmann et al. (2017)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2017/03/aa29692-16/aa29692-16.html). It reconstructs the core of a stellar profile within a specified radius such that it is consistent with having the core condensed into a point mass with softened gravitational potential.

## Requirements
Python 3.7 or higher

pipenv (can be installed from the command line using `pip install pipenv`)

Git

## Installation

Clone a copy of this repo by running the command `git clone https://github.com/TomReichardt/ModifiedLE.git`

Change to the new ModifiedLE directory, `cd ModifiedLE`

Run `pipenv install` inside this directory, which should create a new virtual environment with all the dependencies from the Pipfile and Pipfile.lock
